9600bps*0.2 (200ms) = 1920/8 = 240 char absolute max
Want some elbow room for framing, possibly IDs

Frame structure

Magic (DVOp)
Superframe seq (2 bytes)
10x
  Opus packet, 20ms, 18 (7200) or 20 (8000) bytes
  CRC-16 (need routine)

Total frame length
4+2+200 = 206 bytes (7200)
4+2+220 = 226 bytes (8000)

65535 * 0.2 = 13107 sec / 60 = 218 minutes
likely overkill. Can steal some bits here if need be.
if 1 byte: 256 * 0.2 = 51 sec
  can we stand the decoder resetting this much?
  trap the rollover condition? (trying to avoid complication)

Decode logic:
If not our magic, pass.
If superframe length mismatch, reset the decoder and pass.

(Much easier sequence detection)
If received seq isn't prev+1, reset the decoder.

iterate over 10 Opus packets in superframe:
check CRC-16
if match, decode
if mismatch, call the PLC

note: to reset decoder: opus_decoder_ctl(dec_ctx, OPUS_RESET_STATE);

other ramblings:
7200 to buy back the bitrate for callsigns?
Do we really need callsigns every super, or once a second (10 supers)?
If we do every super, CRC "protect" the callsigns and the frame seq?

Is this even worth it?

Warning
    Only the MDCT mode of Opus can provide hard CBR behavior. 

Hard CBR. For LPC/hybrid modes at very low bit-rate, this can cause noticeable quality degradation. 

Try 2a may be a frame with fewer subframes listing variable lengths to allow VBR to function.
